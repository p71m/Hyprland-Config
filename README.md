# Hyprland-Config
My Hyprland Config + Waybar
just replace your ~/.config/hypr and ~/.config/waybar with my folders and you should be good to go

this all is still a WIP and is nothing special for now, but it is mine and I am proud of it :)

Things I installed to make it work:

yay -S nvidia-open
yay -S xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
